# 30 Day Map Challenge

## Day 01: Points
Libraries used: pandas | geopandas | shapely | keplergl

For the first day I wanted a quick win (spoiler: didn't work out) to stay motivated which didn't work out as intended. I wanted to show the difference of the centroid of France when considering the overseas areas in comparison to when considering only the mainland. The same applies to Hamburg to some degree due to an exclave called "Neuwerk" close to the North Sea.

## Day 02: Lines
Libraries used: pandas | geopandas | altair

Inspired by the [US ZIPScribble Map](https://eagereyes.org/zipscribble-maps/united-states) I've looked for a way to replicate the same process to Germany. Mainly I wanted to see if regions will be as neatly divideable by ZIP codes in Germany as well.

## Day 03: Polygons
Libraries used: geopandas | pandas | keplergl

A while back I've read an article about the Gender Pay Gap in Germany and how it's still a problem in most places. I also got some data for Germany but wanted to look at how Germany compares to other countries in the EU/Europe. I could get my hands on some data from the European Comission (Eurostat), combined the data with the corresponding areas and created a simple plot. Maybe I'll revisit this when doing interactive plots to show the difference of the Gender Pay Gap over time!

## Day 04: Colour Friday (Green)
Libraries used: osmnx | matplotlib

I was looking for the "greenest" city in Europe (how ever that might be determined) and stumbled upon the website of the European Commission which, each year, awards a city with the "European Green Capital Award". Next years winner is Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Looking up Tallinn, I've seen quite some greenery in Mustamäe. Mustamäe translates to "Black Hill" which, in fact, looked pretty green from above which is why I decided to show it in todays map!
