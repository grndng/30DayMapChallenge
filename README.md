# 30 Days Map Challenge

## Day 01: Points
Libraries used: pandas | geopandas | shapely | keplergl

For the first day I wanted a quick win (spoiler: didn't work out) to stay motivated which didn't work out as intended. I wanted to show the difference of the centroid of France when considering the overseas areas in comparison to when considering only the mainland. The same applies to Hamburg to some degree due to an exclave called "Neuwerk" close to the North Sea.

Inspired by the [US ZIPScribble Map](https://eagereyes.org/zipscribble-maps/united-states) I've looked for a way to replicate the same process to Germany. Mainly I wanted to see if regions will be as neatly divideable by ZIP codes in Germany as well.
