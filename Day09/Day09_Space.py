"""30DayMapChallenge | Day 09: Space

I had literally no idea what to do for today since I 
don't know any way to plot things in a coordinate system
that's not on our planet. Which is why I decided not to
look at space directly but to people who went to space. 
To be more precise I took a look at the countries of origin
and gender of people who are part of the crew of the 
International Space Station and have visualised it.
